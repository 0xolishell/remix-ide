Testing using Chai & Mocha
===================

_(Supported since Remix IDE v0.22.0)_

Remix supports testing of your files in JavaScript using assertion library [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) & test framework [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

_Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework._

_Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun._
