Foundry Provider
------------------

 **Foundry Provider** is a plugin on Remix IDE which enables users to deploy the contract to the Foundry's built-in **Anvil** blockchain. `Foundry Provider` can be chosen from the list of environments in `Deploy & Run Transactions` plugin.

As soon as you select `Foundry Provider`, a modal is opened asking for the `Anvil JSON-RPC Endpoint`.

If Foundry Anvil node is running with default options, the default endpoint value in modal will not need any change. In case, Anvil node host and port are different, JSON-RPC endpoint should be updated in the modal text box.

Once the correct endpoint is filled in the modal, just click on `OK` and the accounts from the Anvil node will be loaded in the `ACCOUNT` section. Network id will also be shown.

Now, one can start deploying the contract from Remix IDE to the local Anvil node as usual.
